					<h2 class="font-semibold">ROLLS ROYCE HIRE FROM CHAUFFEUR.COM</h2>
					<h3 class="font-regular">Passionate about Rolls Royce Motorcars and Chauffeuring</h3>
					<p class="font-light">For our discerning clientiele are interested in what fuels Chauffeur.co's passion for the Rolls Royce Motor Car and why our business ethos is not simply that of providing a ‘taxi’ service with a superior car and driver, but more one of providing a luxury experience in the best car in the world – the Rolls Royce – and a professional chauffeur specialising in taking care of your every need while you travel with us, we thought you might enjoy the following</p>

					<h3 class="font-regular">The Difference Between a Driver and a Chauffeur</h3>
					<p class="font-light">Chauffeur is derived from the French word for ”Stoker” referencing times gone by when the process of starting an engine was far more complex than it is now.
					Over 130 years ago when motorcars were first introduced they were very unreliable and if you were wealthy enough to afford one you wouldn’t consider not having a chauffeur in order to take care of your vehicle and ensure your journey was as smooth as possible.</p>
					<p class="font-light">As years went past and cars became more commonplace and affordable, for the wealthy the chauffeur service remained. As these cars became more reliable the role of the chauffeur changed from being less mechanical and more service led.
					The chauffeur is a true professional, believing in taking care of their clients completely ensuring that every element of their journey is taken care of. Their geographical, historical and social knowledge of the City is second to none.
					The chauffeur can offer recommendations for restaurants, accommodation and entertainment. Above all a chauffeur will pre-empt and second-guess passenger requirements, leave nothing to chance and be a true professional at all times.</p>
